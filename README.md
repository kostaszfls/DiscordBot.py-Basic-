# DiscordBot.py-Basic-

To get started, make sure you have the discord.py library installed. You can install it by running pip install discord.py in your command prompt or terminal.

Make sure to replace 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN' with the actual token of your Discord bot. You can obtain a bot token by creating a bot application on the Discord Developer Portal.

Once you have saved the code to a file, you can run it using Python. The bot will be online and ready to respond to commands prefixed with !. For example, you can use commands like !kick @username or !clear 10 to kick a user or clear messages respectively.
